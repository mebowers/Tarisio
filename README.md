# Tarisio
This is my Shiny app with Python project for NYC Data Science Academy. I am a professional violinist and chose to use data from Tarisio.com, the worldâ€™s leading auction house for fine stringed instruments and bows, so that I could explore and compare auction records of different instrument makers and consider how values have changed over time. 

This project was used to create an app for the purposes of data visualization and exploration. It does not encompass analysis of the data. 

## Data Overview:
The dataset covers nearly 200 years of sales records and features data on stringed instrument makers, sale price, sale date, and type of instrument. 

## Project Highlights:
I scraped data from Tarisio.com using Beautiful Soup, reflecting sales records through October 2024.

I created a Shiny dashboard app using Python to visualize the data and allow users to explore aution records for themselves.
