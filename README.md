# Tarisio
Tarisio dashboard with Shiny Python


## Introduction:
This is my dashboard app visualizing stringed instrument and bow auction data scraped from Tarisio.com's Cozio Archive.


## Data:
Data was scraped from Tarisio.com's Makers pages in October 2024 and covers nearly 200 years of sales records.  


## Project:
The goal of this project was to make a dashboard app using Shiny and Python. I am a professional violinist and chose to use data from Tarisio, the worldâ€™s leading auction house for fine stringed instruments and bows, so that I could explore and compare auction records of different instrument makers and consider how values have changed over time.
